            <h2>About Animal</h2>
            <p>
                Animal care is a vital responsibility that involves meeting the physical, emotional, and social needs of
                animals to ensure their well-being and overall quality of life. It is essential for both domesticated
                pets and animals in farms, zoos, and wildlife habitats. Proper animal care focuses on providing a safe
                and comfortable living environment, adequate nutrition, regular health checks, socialization, and
                opportunities for natural behaviors. By recognizing animals as sentient beings capable of experiencing
                emotions, humans must commit to treating them with respect, compassion, and responsibility.

                A significant part of animal care revolves around providing a suitable environment that meets the needs
                of the animal. This means ensuring that they have enough space to move around comfortably, proper
                shelter, and a clean and safe habitat. The environment should be free from hazards and provide
                protection from extreme weather conditions, predators, and other stressors. The living area should also
                be enriched to allow animals to engage in natural behaviors, such as climbing, digging, or foraging,
                depending on the species. Enrichment activities, such as toys, puzzles, and opportunities for
                exploration, are especially important for pets and captive animals to prevent boredom and stress.

                Nutrition is a key component of animal care. Every species has specific dietary requirements that need
                to be met to maintain optimal health. Providing a balanced diet tailored to an animal’s unique needs is
                crucial for growth, energy, immune function, and overall well-being. Whether it’s a carnivorous cat that
                needs a high-protein diet, an herbivorous rabbit that needs fiber-rich food, or livestock such as cows
                that require nutritious forage, it is essential to understand the dietary needs of different animals. In
                addition, clean and fresh water should always be available to prevent dehydration and support bodily
                functions.
