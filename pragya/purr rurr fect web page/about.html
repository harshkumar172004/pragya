            <h2>About Animal</h2>
            <p>
                Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that belong to the biological kingdom Animalia. They
                exhibit a wide range of forms, behaviors, and habitats, and they play an essential role in ecosystems
                around the world. Below is an overview of key information about animals:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Animals are classified into different groups based on their characteristics. The classification
                    system includes:

                    Kingdom: Animalia
                    Phylum: Animals are divided into various phyla based on their body structure, such as Chordata
                    (vertebrates), Arthropoda (insects, spiders), Mollusca (snails, squids), and others.
                    Classes, Orders, Families, Genera, Species: Further divisions are used to categorize animals into
                    more specific groups, eventually leading to individual species.</li>

                <li>Animals are broadly categorized into:

                    Vertebrates: Animals with a backbone, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.
                    Invertebrates: Animals without a backbone, which include insects, arachnids, mollusks, crustaceans,
                    and more.</li>

                <li>Animals are found in nearly every environment on Earth, including:

                    Terrestrial: Forests, grasslands, deserts, mountains.
                    Aquatic: Freshwater (rivers, lakes) and marine (oceans, seas).
                    Aerial: Birds and some insects have adapted to spend much of their time in the air.</li>

                <li>
                    Animals have evolved a wide range of adaptations to survive in their environments:

                    Physical Adaptations: Physical features such as fur, scales, camouflage, and specialized limbs.
                    Behavioral Adaptations: Migration, hibernation, nocturnal activity, and social behaviors.
                    Physiological Adaptations: Ability to regulate body temperature, specialized digestion, and immune
                    system responses.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Animals have diverse dietary preferences based on their ecological niches:

                    Herbivores: Eat plants (e.g., cows, rabbits).
                    Carnivores: Eat other animals (e.g., lions, eagles).
                    Omnivores: Eat both plants and animals (e.g., humans, bears).
                    Detritivores: Feed on dead organic matter (e.g., earthworms).
                    Filter Feeders: Filter food particles from water (e.g., whales, some shellfish).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Animals reproduce in various ways:

                    Sexual Reproduction: Most animals reproduce sexually, involving the combination of male and female
                    gametes.
                    Asexual Reproduction: Some invertebrates, like certain species of starfish and flatworms, can
                    reproduce without the involvement of another individual.
                    Oviparous: Animals that lay eggs (e.g., birds, reptiles).
                    Viviparous: Animals that give birth to live young (e.g., mammals).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Animals display a range of social behaviors, including:

                    Solitary Behavior: Some animals are solitary, only interacting during mating (e.g., tigers).
                    Group Living: Others live in groups for safety, hunting, or rearing young (e.g., wolves, elephants).
                    Communication: Animals use sounds, body language, chemical signals, and visual displays to
                    communicate with each other.
